# Trello like task manager

Since the task was to create three column task planner I decided to create trello-like app.

So what we've got here. 
* We can create any number of columns with any number of tasks. 
* Columns and tasks can be rearanged by drag-n-drop technique.
* To edit task or column name double click it.
* User data is stored at local storage.
* Project is based on Backbone framework and assembled with Yeoman scaffolding (backbone generator), Grunt tasks and Bower components.
* To run project simply open 'dist/index.html' or run 'grunt serve'
* Localstorage is unavailable in IE when run from local file.
